# README
This app should create and maintain a list of apartments, each with attributes address, city, state, #bedrooms (just called bedrooms), #bathrooms (just called bathrooms). These are stored in a sqlite3 database. I created the resource apartments with the scaffold command for ruby, so MVC code is all auto generated. I am using webpack to handle react as my frontend. This list should include the ability to edit a listing, add or delete a listing, and view each listing. 

To use: This includes a seed file with three sample apartments. To use, once you've downloaded this open terminal and go into the app's directory. Then do rake db:create to create the database. Then, do rake db:seed to get data from the seed file to the database. Then, do rake db:migrate. The database should be set up now. 

To run the program, in its directory type 'foreman start' into the command line. Then, in your browser navigate to http://localhost:5000. This is where they app should display.
