# README
This app should create and maintain a list of apartments, each with attributes address, city, state, #bedrooms (just called bedrooms), #bathrooms (just called bathrooms). These are stored in a sqlite3 database. I created the resource apartments with the scaffold command for ruby, so MVC code is all auto generated. I am using webpack to handle react as my frontend. This list should include the ability to edit a listing, add or delete a listing, and view each listing.
